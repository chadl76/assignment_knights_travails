[A data structures and algorithms Ruby challenge from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Chad Lucas

What data structure is used to implement DFS?
What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?
Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)
Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?
What is the difference between a tree and a graph?
Next, pseudocode the following processes with enough detail to be clear:

Searching a simple tree of nodes where each Node has an array of child nodes (some_node.children) using DFS.
Searching the same tree using BFS.
Searching a graph (represented however you feel most comfortable -- Edge List, Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix) using DFS.
Searching the same graph using BFS.
